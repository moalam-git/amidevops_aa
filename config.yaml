# Each line represents a property (key-value pair). 
#   The property key (left side of colon) is a fixed keyword and should not be altered. 
#   The property value (right side of colon) is for user input.    
#   The alignment or spacing for the property key and value should not be changed. It may result in an unexpected error. The YAML file only works with proper alignment.
#   For property values with multiple lines, specify the pipe | character after the property key.  On the following line, indent the lines with values.
